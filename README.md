# ft_printf
This project is my copy of standard printf function in C language.


Regardless of the programming language considered, the printf function,(or its equivalents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the
support of diverse types in variable numbers. Some variations even propose to be able to
write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream.
Some also propose to recall this string without printing it. In short, undeniably, printf
is a vital function.

Allowed functions:
◦ write
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ exit
◦ The functions of man 3 stdarg


To use this function, run make command.
